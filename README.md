# ML-Model-Car-price-prediction
🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts the price of used cars using regression algorithms based on various car features.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

🔍 Problem Statement

Used car prices depend on multiple factors such as brand, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, and year.
This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates car prices accurately using machine learning techniques.
